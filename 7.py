        Question: List slicing is important in various data manipulation activities. Let's do a few more exercises on that.
        
        Please complete the script so that it prints out the first three items of list letters.
        
        letters = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j"]
        Expected output: 
        
        ['a', 'b', 'c']

letters = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j"]

print(letters[:3])
